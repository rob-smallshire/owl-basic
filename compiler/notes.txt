Ive made this so we can leave each other notes.

I have downloaded the changelist for bbc basic from the source tree. Here is some of the interesting bits

Partial setting of @% is supported:

@%="+":REM turn on STR$
@%="G":REM go to G format (turns off STR$)
@%="10":REM set just the field width for current format (turns off STR$)
@%=".5":REM set just the precision for current format (turns of STR$)
@%="+F10":REM turn on STR$, go to F format and set field width 10
@%="E10.3":REM go to E format, field width 10, 3 digits in total
@%="+F20.4":REM turn on STR$, go to F, field width 20, 4 digits after '.'

Spaces cannot be used. LET @%= does not cope with the string form. Replace
"." with "," to get "," used as the decimal point character.



TRACE to file

TRACE output can be directed to a file with TRACE TO "<file name>": all TRACE
output is sent to the file until TRACE CLOSE is issued [the interpreter will
close the trace file before exit]. Note that errors found when writing to this
file will result in it being closed and forgotten about. The variable TRACE
allows the programmer to output other things to the trace file (e.g. with
IF TRACE THEN BPUT#TRACE,"X is "+STR$X)

Note that TRACE now allows line number and PROC tracing to be on together:
TRACE PROC:TRACE ON (say).



some original bugs in bbc basic and test code

17-Nov-88   Fixed TAN1E-5 bug (misread the flow chart in Cody and Waite!)
02-Dec-88   -1^-10 blew up
14-Mar-89   " unlistable token " not terminated by >&7F
15-Jun-89   F1XSUB, F1SUB could return -0 which various xxSTAs can't cope with
17-Jul-89   Difference between IF THENELSE and IF THEN ELSE fixed
18-Aug-89   Cache not being flushed on errors could cause problems with EVAL
12-Oct-89   Bug in printing 0 in E mode removed
17-Oct-89   INT-(3*2^30) didn't give error
19-Oct-89   Assembler OPT not reset on -chain or -quit
24-Oct-89   A()=B() messed up
03-Nov-89   Change to ADVAL to return all 32 bits
11-Dec-89   TRACE TO "printer:" didn't work because of the type setting

Changes to TRACE such that line numbers and PROC/FN info produced

(1) GCOLr,g,b and GCOL action,r,g,b call ColourTrans_SetGCOL
(2) MODEn where n>255 calls OS_ScreenMode
(3) MODE <string> calls *wimpmode <string>
(4) COLOUR r,g,b calls ColourTrans_SetColour (note that it can't
    do as well as (1) above since a four parameter COLOUR call
    already exists)
    
* TRACE PROC (and the identical TRACE FN) now flushes the VCACHE when
  it is encountered. This is important, because procedure and function
  calls are normally cached to avoid looking-up the name and searching
  for the location of the DEF.

  When tracing is active, we don't add any procedure or function calls
  to the cache, because we can't output the name to the trace output
  (without parsing it - hence slowing-down cache behaviour).

  So, we now flush the VCACHE at the start of PROC/FN tracing so that
  all calls are reported (before, the cached ones would not appear in
  the trace output).

* TRACE ENDPROC has been implemented to allow the output of 'ENDPROC'
  and 'ENDFN' in the trace output whenever a procedure or function is
  exited. This complements the TRACE PROC/FN functionality.

* QUIT <expression> has been added to allow a return code to be passed
  back to the called when BASIC exits. This is the /only/ sensible way
  for a BASIC program to set Sys$ReturnCode on exit (others get trashed
  when BASIC removes it's environment handlers).

* New syntax for MODE: MODE <width>,<height>,<bpp>[,<framerate>]

  Uses OS_ScreenMode 0, rather than *WimpMode. bpp may be 1,2,4,6,8,16
  or 32. 8 selects a full palette 256-colour mode, 6 an old-style one.

* COLOUR and GCOL both allow colour numbers rather than old-style
  colours. Also, background colours can be set with R,G,B forms.

  COLOUR [OF f] [ON b]
  COLOUR [[OF] r,g,b] [ON r,g,b]
  GCOL [OF [<action>],f] [ON [<action>],b]
  GCOL [[OF] [<action>,]r,g,b] [ON [<action>,]r,g,b]

  For COLOUR R,G,B, the OF is unnecessary, but provided for uniformity.
  For GCOL R,G,B, OF tightens up the usage of <action> - without it
  <action>is passed in to both R3 and R4 of ColourTrans_SetGCOL for
  backwards compatibility (some may have used GCOL 128,r,g,b to
  set the background colour - although this ends up setting reserved
  flags in the ColourTrans_SetGCOL call).

  * Used as a function VDU n returns the value of the specified VDU
  variable.
  
  * Added the DIM <var> LOCAL <expr> syntax which allows blocks to be
  claimed local to a PROC/FN that are automatically released on exit
  or error.
  
BB4W keywords that will need implimenting at a later date.

32bit line numbering

if we impliment 32 bit line numbering we can make the file load on a 16 bit system by having a special header
	\x00\x00\xf4 This file uses 32bit line numbering. Imposible to load on 16bit system\n\xff\xff
this will produce the line:
	0 REM This file uses 32bit line numbering. Imposible to load on 16bit system
when listed and will not crash the old interpreter and allow the OWL compiler to detect 32 bit line numbering
it is also possible to detect with a simpe IF stmt.


*all tokenised programs must have line numbers (check how bbc basic for windows does it 16/32 bit)
open file
read first line
if line is started with 16/32 bittoken then 
	use line numbering.(will need a flag at start of file for 32 bit)
	set a flag in grammer checker that tells it to decode the first 0/2/4 bytes of each line as a line number.
	if flag is set and a token that requires a line number is found then check the data after token for encoded line number
if file is started with ascii numeric value then no line number decoding is needed
